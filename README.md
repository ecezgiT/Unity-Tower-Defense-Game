# Unity Tower Defense Game

A 2D strategy game developed in Unity, focusing on scalable object-oriented architecture. The project demonstrates advanced C# concepts, including polymorphism and inheritance, to manage complex game states and enemy behaviors.

## Key Features
* **OOP Architecture:** specific enemy types (e.g., `ZombieEnemy`) inherit from a robust `EnemyBase` class to share logic while maintaining unique stats.
* **Wave System:** Dynamic spawner that manages difficulty progression and enemy pooling for performance.
* **Game Mechanics:** Interactive tower placement, health/resource management, and win/loss states.
* **UI/UX:** Integrated main menus using Unity's UI system.

## Tech Stack
* **Engine:** Unity 2022
* **Language:** C#
* **Concepts:** Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction
